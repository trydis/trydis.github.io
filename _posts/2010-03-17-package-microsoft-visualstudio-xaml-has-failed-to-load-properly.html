<p>I just wanted to give you a heads up, in case you experience the same problem I faced yesterday. After installing the <a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/windows-phone-7-series/" target="_blank">Windows Phone 7 developer tools</a> Visual Studio 2008 suddenly started giving me “Package Load Failure” errors when opening one of my WPF projects. </p>
<p>Here’s what the error message looks like:</p>
<p><em>Package Load Failure      <br />Package 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Xaml' has failed to load properly ( GUID = {E58C2A8B-BCC4-4559-AD59-D62EB6D58A22} ). Please contact package vendor for assistance. Application restart is recommended, due to possible environment corruption. Would you like to disable loading this package in the future? You may use 'devenv /resetskippkgs' to re-enable package loading.</em> </p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem is related to the order in which you install the Express SKU and the Standard SKU, which can leave the system in a broken state.</p>
<p>To fix this problem you can run the standalone <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FBEE1648-7106-44A7-9649-6D9F6D58056E&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 installer</a>.</p>
